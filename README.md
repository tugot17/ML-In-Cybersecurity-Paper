# ML-In-Cybersecurity-Paper
This document is summary of my presentation about Real and Stealthy Attacks on State-of-the-Art Face Recognition Systems at the Seminar: Machine Learning in Cyber-security Sommer Semester 18/19 at FU Berlin. My presentation was based on [Accessorize to a Crime: Real and Stealthy Attacks on State-of-the-Art Face Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sbhagava/papers/face-rec-ccs16.pdf) paper. Sharif et al  came up with idea of generating an eyeglass frames, which when worn by an attacker allow him/her to avoid being recognized as himself/herselfor to impersonate another person from biometric system database. Presentation I gave during the seminar discussed details of generating such eyeglass frames.
